                    Design to run your retail business smoothly</h4>
                    <p>One of the main functions of Liteclerk POS is to record transactions that
                    your store made. Recording sales transactions quickly in your system is very
                    important when waiting lines are growing, so having a software that allows
                    scanning and selling products without wasting time is beneficial for 
                    a retail business.</p>

                <div className="sector">

                    Track your sales and inventory with ease</h4>
                    <p>Liteclerk POS with Cloud allow you to transfer inventory between stores. This makes it 
                        easy to consult the products that have been transferred, the description and the reason 
                        for the transfer. This feature allows you to offer better customer service and to avoid 
                        missing sales in case of lack of inventory.</p>

                    <p>You can use Liteclerk Cloud from any device with an internet connection. Liteclerk Cloud
                        keeps small business owners connected to their data from their branches. The Liteclerk

                        submissions from your Expenses dashboard and create, validate, or refuse them in just a
